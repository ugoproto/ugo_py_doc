A Python documentation website.

- **ugo\_py\_doc** is a corpus; a catalog of books, manuals, articles, presentations, videos, podcasts, summaries, notes, code snippets, excerpts, websites, etc.
- The 'docs' is a searchable knowledge-based system.
- You type a keyword, it leads to several sources, you identify the document, and you go retrieve the document; whether it is a digital or a material document. Fast and easy!
- The corpus is unstructured. Knowledge is rather cumulated, layer after layer, resulting in a hotchpotch of information. Information may be repeted among many documents, with different explanations, some more comprehensive. Newer entries might also supplement or contradict older entries.
